### Paraphrasing

#### What is Paraphrasing

Expressing another person's words or ideas in your own words is called paraphrasing.

#### How to Paraphrase

- Ensure that a sequence of three words will not be the same as the original.
- Do not change any of the ideas in the original information.
- Do not remove any ideas, or add new ones.

Can't be changed:

1. proper nouns such as names of people, organizations, places: Albert Einstein, New Zealand.
2. Common nouns that are difficult to reword efficiently: computer , mosquito, atmosphere, winter.
3. Technical terms: genetically modified foods, DNA.
4. Number and dates: 57%, 2014, April 20.

#### Characteristics of a good paraphrase

- The paraphrase has the same meaning as the original writing.
- The paraphrase is roughly the same length as the original writing.
- The original words and structures of the source, except fo r technical words or very common words("public domain" words), have been rephrased.

#### Techniques used to Paraphrase

1. Use appropriate synonyms

    such as:
 
    | word                | synonym             |
    |:--------------------|:--------------------|
    | syringe             | needle              |
    | eliminate a disease | eradicate a disease |
    | disease             | sickness            |
    | develop immunity    | acquire resistance  |
    | vaccination         | immunization        |
    | immune from         | protected against   |

2. Change the sentence type

3. Change the voice from active to passive or from passiv e to active.
