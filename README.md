    | word                | synonym             |
    |:--------------------|:--------------------|

    | eliminate a disease | eradicate a disease |
    | disease             | sickness            |

- A summary reflects what the original contains, whereas an abstract reflects what the original is about.
- A summary contains the meat of the original, whereas an abstract contains only its skeletal structure.
- When you write a paper, an abstract is needed, but you don't need to write a summary. 
  We can say Summary is a kind of tool.

### Similarities and differences between summary and paraphrase

- Both of them translate another person's ideas into your own words.
- A paraphrase is usually the same length as the original source;
  a summary is approximately one quarter to one third of the original writing's length.

### How to write a summary

- Read the original source carefully. Underline only the main points of the writing.
  And eliminate the details, example and repetition points.
- Paraphrase the underline sections of the original source.
- Your summary should include:
  + the introduction to the summary;
  + a reference to the source text;
  + the reporting verb structure;
  + the main point of the source text.

# Unit 5 Patterns

## Unit 5-1 Citations and references

### Words


### Function

In academic writing, writers use citations and references to acknowledge the ideas of earlier authors in order to avoid plagiarism([ˈpleɪdʒərɪzəm] 抄袭，剽窃).

**Function**: Citations and references give the readers access to information about sources cited in the text.

#### Citations(in-text citation/reference)

- provide information, in brief, about the source of the original materials. There are two general types of citation systems: **numbered** and **author-date**.
  - **The numbered system**: each number in the text corresponds to a numbered entry in a Note section at the end of the text.
  - **The author-date system**: the names of the authors(only family name) and date of publication appear in the parentheses of the text, and each citation corresponds to an entry in the Reference section at the end of the text.


#### References

provide complete information about a source and is found at the of the text in a ***References***, ***Works Cited*** or in a ***Notes section***.

In a References part, or Note section, entries include the author’s name, date of publication, title of the work, page number, publisher, location of publisher (if a book), issue and volume number(卷号) (if a journal, magazine, or newspaper article) or URL (the address of a web page on the world wide web if found on a website). The entries are listed in alphabetical order according to the author’s last name. 

### What to cite and reference, and what not to cite

**Writers must reference:**

- exact quotation.
- specific ideas
- specific facts learned from another source of information.
- specific research results
- specific statistics
- specific examples discovered from another source of information.

### Forms of citation

- **Quotation**
- **Paraphrase**
- **Summary**
