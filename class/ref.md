5 g technology and the integration of the Internet of things development is conducive to increase the number of 5 g network access equipment scale, and create new Internet access means for the development of the Internet of things based on 5 g technology of iot structure more reasonable more convenient safe, and the economic cost is low wait for after the completion of 5 g technology put into commercial use, can provide new iot building solutions, obvious advantages

Internet of Things is transforming real devices to smart intelligent virtual devices. In IoT day today devices of daily use are manufactured along with sensors which are capable for identification and sensing. They can be networked, are capable to process, can interact with other devices through Internet. IoT objective is to connect almost everything under a common infrastructure. This helps to control devices and will keep us informed about the status of devices. The paper aims to give Internet of Things overview, architectures, enabling technologies and their applications. It presents latest trends, current state, recent developments, challenges, security, privacy, applications of IoT and future research directions.

For the development of the Internet of things, the biggest problem is to meet the large demand.
